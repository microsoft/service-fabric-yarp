      <!--
        NOTE 1: Don't tell Service Fabric we're using Protocol="https" because we don't need http.sys setup.
        Specifying https would require us to also specify a certificate binding for Service Fabric to be satisfied,
        whereas SFYarp takes care of TLS certificate binding on its own.

        NOTE 2: We *do* specify Protocol="http" for the http endpoint so that the address that appears in SF Explorer for SFYarp
        "looks" nicer. Service Fabric's KestrelCommunicationListener does not support exposing 2 endpoints for the same listener,
        and it mistakenly uses the endpoint's Protocol instead of UriScheme to produce the final endpoint listener address.
        Ultimately none of this really matters since nobody needs to query Service Fabric to find SFYarp's public endpoint,
        so whether we set Protocol="http" or "tcp" for these  endpoints is purely cosmetic.

        NOTE 3: While we don't care about the http.sys arrangements that Service Fabric does
        in reaction to these endpoint definiions, we *do* care about the Windows Firewall configs this takes care of.
        Without this, we might need to configure Windows Firewall ourselves to accept inbound traffic to these ports.
