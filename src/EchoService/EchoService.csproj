      .NET Core SDK 3.1 SDK sets ServerGarbageCollection=true by default for Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web projects,
      which is a bad default for shared hosting platforms.
      Re. ServerGarbageCollection, from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/workstation-server-gc:
        "Server garbage collection can be resource-intensive. For example, imagine that there are 12 processes
        that use server GC running on a computer that has four processors. If all the processes happen to collect garbage
        at the same time, they would interfere with each other, as there would be 12 threads scheduled on the same processor.
        If the processes are active, it's not a good idea to have them all use server GC."
      Re. ConcurrentGarbageCollection, from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/background-gc:
        "Concurrent garbage collection enables interactive applications to be more responsive by minimizing pauses
        for a collection. Managed threads can continue to run most of the time while the concurrent garbage collection thread
        is running. This results in shorter pauses while a garbage collection is occurring."
